                    I was born in a city in the northeastern corner of Italy; however, I only spent about 2 or 3 years in Italy before my parents moved to the states for a job opportunity.
                    The first place we moved to was a small township in Michigan about 40 minutes from Detroit where I spent most of my life. However, my parents got bored with Michigan so we moved to 
                    Southwest Utah where I currently reside. Despite moving out at a young age, my family never abandoned the rest of the family in Italy. Some of my fondest memories come from spending time in Italy 
                    during the summer or winter. For as long as I can remember I've had a deep interest in computers and technology in general.
                    I've taken many computer classes as well as joined a few clubs (notably cyberpatriot and CSHS). My goal after high school is to get a career in IT and get tons of money.

                    My first proper foray into web development; HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers was a very useful course for me.
                    It taught a lot of basic things about web development as well as some more advanced topics.
                    This course involved learning new concepts, troubleshooting existing websites and creating new ones entirely from scratch.
                    My favorite part about the class, however, was actually a bit of a tangent the course had to have us learn about git, which was the first time I had to use the command line for web development.

                    In 2024 I took a class called computer systems which focused more on the hardware side of computers.
                    It was a class that aimed to teach its students more about IT than about programming, as other classes had done.
                    At the end of the year, we took the testout pc pro test that covered all we had learned up to that point. The test itself wasn't that difficult, so I got above a 90% pretty easily.
                    This class was probably my favorite computer class that I took in high school, mainly because of the teardowns we did of random computers.

                    This is a certificate for one of the more recent classes I have taken and also happens to be what I made this website for. 
                    Web Development I is a basic web development class that teaches the basics of web development. In all honesty, I probably should've just skipped to Web Development 2, as this class simply taught concepts and terms I was already familiar with.
                    This certificate was a result of a youscience test I took towards the end of 2024, which also took me about 6 minutes to complete and gave me a 95% score.

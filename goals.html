                    Currently, I'm studying to get into the cybersecurity space. It has always been a great passion of mine to secure networks, as well as make tons of money.
                    Specifically, I hope to become a network administrator so I can manage a big network and tell other people what they can and can't do on the network.
                    Right now I'm working at Best Buy to make some money and get experience that'll (hopefully) help me in my quest to further my career.
                    It's definitely not as simple as little caesar's but it's a million times more relaxing. Anyways my hope is to get a degree from a university in Italy so that
                    maybe I can claim diversity. The important part right now is to get off my feet and get some money while I'm at it.

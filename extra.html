                    Computer Science Honor Society is an after school club dedicated to getting people excited about technology.
                    Not only am I a part of this club, I am the president of this club, which is a very scary thing because it's probably the most amount of responsibility I've had in my entire life.
                    Even with all this stress, it's still an experience I think I should have and at the very least, I owe it to the people who put me in this position to at least try and to not kill it off.
                    One of our events is the outreach event we have in February, which brings in people from around the city to get their kids to learn about technology.
